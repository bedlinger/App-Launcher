A simple app launcher for Windows created with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/). It's a small tool that allows you to quickly launch your favorite applications.

## Motivation

I created this app to learn how to use [Tauri](https://tauri.app/). It's a great tool to create desktop applications with web technologies. Also I was unhappy the windows search and wanted a simple tool to quickly launch my apps.
