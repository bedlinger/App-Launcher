## Motivation

I created this app to learn how to use [Tauri](https://tauri.app/). It's a great tool to create desktop applications with web technologies. Also I was unhappy the windows search and wanted a simple tool to quickly launch my apps.

## Features

- Search for installed applications
- Launch applications either by clicking on them or go through the list with `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` and press enter
- Open the location of the application
- Press `Ctrl+Space` to highlight the search bar
- Press `Alt+S` to open/close the App-Launcher, but you can change this shortcut in the settings
- Settings to change the theme, the behavior when the app starts and add it to the autostart
